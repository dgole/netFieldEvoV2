# netFieldEvoV2

This code evolves the net-magnetic-flux and surface density of an accretion disk while self-consistently solving a static disk model at each point in time.  For a full description of the model and it's implementation, see chapter 3 of my thesis work: https://dgole.github.io/pages/thesis.html.
